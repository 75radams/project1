	<h1>Behind The Camera</h1>

	<section>
		<h2>Who is Dom</h2>
		<p>I am an up and coming visual artist from Atlanta, Georgia using a video camera as my median. Currently I am a third year undergraduate student at the Georgia Tech, studying computational media. Growing up in Atlanta I was always exposed to a lot of pop culture, may that be music, art, or fashion. I developed a desire to be apart of that culture.</p>
		<p>Once I picked up a video camera it took off from there. They say a picture is worth a thousand words and well a video is worth at least a thousand pictures so I feel as though nothing truly captures a moment like a video does. This is my portfolio website where you may view my works and projects. Feel free to contact me if you wish to join the team.</p>
